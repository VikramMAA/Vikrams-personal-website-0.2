A brief insight to how my first day as a freelancer progressed.
<!--more-->

## Paragraph

Ever since my college I’ve been in a job at Mapletree Farms. I’ve taken up multiple roles there. It had been a little over 4 years working there. I started off as a customer support executive then got involved in operations and then finally Marketing. This is where I got the time to learn from online sources about digital marketing. There were very few opportunities to learn from people around me. It wasn’t until the last four months that I actually got to learn something from people around me.

My last day at Mapletree was a mix of emotions. The weather was gloomy and did not help. Although my send off was a blast and unexpected. It felt great to be starting something that I’ve wanted to do for a long time now. I felt I finally had the knowledge to succeed in this venture that I was starting off.
I was super excited about the first day. My energy levels were high and I was enjoying every moment of it for maybe an hour. This was when I realized I was lost and had no idea what to be doing. I called people randomly from their posts on facebook groups, I searched for my favorite pubs in bangalore and called them to see if they were interested in my offering. I was hesitant to call a lot of people because they were already doing a good job on social media and this was the area that I wanted to focus on. I never got any response from the calls. My messages to business on instagram went unanswered. Of all the calls I made I only got a response from one of the pubs near my house. The owner was clear that he was already someone doing his social media work but was open to talking. He didn’t respond after that though. 

Once I was done with the calls and the disappointment I moved on to do other things like learning from online sources and googling how to get new clients. These did not seem to help.
Being a marketing manager for Mapletree has taught me that a lot of cold calls go unanswered and the only way to keep doing it along with the other activities. My experience was the only thing that kept me going.

I spoke to my friends about this first day and they too assured me that it was just the first day and there is still a lot of time.
I guess this is the part I mention that I’ve given myself till the end of March 2022 to work on this venture in my life and see if I can earn a decent income from this. If not, I will have to look for another job.

In the days to follow I had moments where I got huge boosts of motivation and confidence. I will tell you all about it in my next blog post.

Thanks for reading :)
