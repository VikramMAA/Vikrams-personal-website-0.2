Experiencing a phase of low energy. If I don't get out of this phase soon my carrer as a freelancer will be over before it even starts. See how I overcom this phase.

## Paragraph

I keep my blogs as raw as possible without sugar coating it or making myself look good. I’m just an average guy trying to make his way through this crazy and adventurous journey that we call life. If you’ve read my second blog [Second week as a freelance digital marketer] you’ll know I had built habits that would label me as a lazy person with no drive. I had to consciously pull myself out of this rut that I was in. It was a little difficult but I managed to do it.

The second month started off a little dull. The meeting I’d set up for the new potential client didn’t happen. I was persistent with following up and ensuring I meet with him because I knew their product had great potential in the market and also it was probably going to be my first client who would need an all round digital marketing service. A week had to passed by before I could connect with him again.
In the meantime I was working for my other 3 clients as well. I went on a short ride to pyramid valley from there to an amazing dam on kanakpura road with my girlfriend. We spent the day riding, kayaking and enjoying good food once we returned home.

A week passed by and I finally got a chance to meet this new potential client. The meeting started well but I felt I lost him in the middle. Remembering what I’d learnt about human behavior I let the client do most of the talking and that’s when it clicked! I’d worked with two very important people in the past 4 years[in my job] whom the client knew personally and had worked with. This was a key factor for me and knowing I’d worked with them and they’d mentored me, gave me a lot of credibility. All that was needed now was for me to present the plan and make a budget and tell him my cost. This was done in the next meeting. The client liked my plan and we chatted about a lot of things for a little over 2 hours. The only thing pending now is for him to sign the contract and for me to sign the NDA.

My friend had set up financial targets for me. The first three months had a target of 15K, 20K, and 25K respectively. If this contract is signed I will have exceeded even my 3 month’s target within the second month. I will have exceeded my third month target by a little over 30% which is truly amazing considering I was expecting to get paid 10K at the end of 3 months.

As I write this blog I’m awaiting for the contract to be signed by the client. It’s a heart pounding wait time for me as this would mean I can continue freelancing and will not need to search for a job at the end of 3 month. My Family will be convinced, my girlfriend will be convinced and more importantly I will have gained a massive amount of confidence in myself.

I will post an update in the next blog I write which will be released at the end of March 2022. Do make sure to read it and thank you for your support :)

Cheers!
