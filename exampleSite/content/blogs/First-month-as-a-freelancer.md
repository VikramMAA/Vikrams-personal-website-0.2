## Paragraph

If you’ve read my previous two blogs you’ll know what rollercoaster ride the first two weeks were. I had a target of earning Rs15,000 in the first month as a freelance digital marketer. I had my review coming up with my friend karthik. I was still short of Rs2,000 even though I had 3 clients already. I had gotten comfortable and was only working with the 3 clients I had. The rest of the time I was not doing much and wasting it watching Netflix, YouTube or playing COD mobile. I knew what I was doing wasn’t going to get me where I wanted to go. I just couldn’t get myself to fall back into my routine that I’d built over the last couple of months.

What was my routine?
Wake up at 4:50Am, Do cardio for 20 minutes, Make a plan for the day for 20 minutes and reflect on the previous day for 15 minutes with a 5 minute meditation session. Post that would be my daily chores and then at 7:30am I’d go cycling for a minimum of 5 kms. I’d come back freshen up, eat breakfast and get to work until 3PM.

This was getting harder and harder to do every day I skipped it.

I didn’t follow up on leads I’d gotten and wasn’t spending time generating leads as well.

Towards the last week of the month I felt like I needed to change this habit of wasting time. I again started trying to follow my routine but to start off I kept it simple and easy. I also started learning how to cook at this point. I followed up on leads and fixed meetings with a potential client who was again a contact of my first client.
I went on a short ride with my friend and visited a few places in Bengaluru as well. This showed me with a little planning I would have a ton of free time to try different things.

I had a review with my friend and unfortunately had to tell him that I’d failed to meet my monthly target.

HONESTLY I never even expected to have one paying client in the first month. I was thrilled that I was getting paid by 3 different companies to get this work done. In a way I exceeded my own expectations. I guess that's why I was given what I would call a stretch goal. I would have probably never achieved even this If I’d stuck to my goal of Rs10,000 at the end of the 3rd month. So thank you KD! :)

The second month gets way too interesting and fun. Make sure to check it out :)

Cheers!
